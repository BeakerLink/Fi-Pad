# Fi-Pad

This is my take on the HackPad for the 2025 Hack Club. It features 9 programable keys, and a 0.91 in OLED screen


## Design

I designed the PCB using Ki-Cad, and designed the case in OnShape

# Firmware Overview

The firmware is still in development, I plan to update this once I have a semifunctional build. It will be based around QKM, and use VIA for dynamic changes.

# What's in a name
I named this project the "Fi-Pad" for two reasons. First of all, some backstory. My name is Link, and with that has come a healthy obsession with "The Ledgend of Zelda" In the games there is a reoccuring item called "The Master Sword." Inside the sword dwells a spirit named "Fi" Which was appointed by the goddess to Assist "Link" In their journey. Bringing this Back to me, I nicknamed my laptop "Fi" because of how it assists me through my journey. And the other reason I named the project "Fi-Pad" is a play on Apple's iPad.
